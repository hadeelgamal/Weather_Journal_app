# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
In this project I create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Description
setup the environment on the server side and included all the needed packages. In the client side in the 'app.js' created an API request with a defined url that include the key ID. The get and post routes in the server side is excuted through the client side in the app.js file

### Prerequisite
npm
node.js
cors
body parser 
express

####Installation
Install npm here is a guide on [how to get npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
Install node.js from the terminal 
```npm install node
```
Install the packages Express, Body-Parser, and Cors from the terminal : 
```npm install express

run the server file using node:

Run the html.index file in the browser

####Testing
When entering the zip code make sure to only test using numeric input, as the API does not take other input types.
